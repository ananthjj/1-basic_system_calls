execve(“./main", ["./main"], 0x7ffea0ed2e90 /* 49 vars */) = 0

SYNOPSIS
#include <unistd.h>
int execve(const char *pathname, char *const argv[],
char *const envp[]);

DESCRIPTION
execve() executes the program referred to by pathname. This causes the program that is currently being run by the calling process to be replaced with a new program, with newly initialized stack, heap, and (initialized and uninitialized) data segments.
The system call’s arguments are a path to the executable ./main and two arrays of string arguments. The first of these arrays holds the filename associated with the file being executed, "./main". The second of these arrays holds the environment as a pointer, 0x7ffea0ed2e90 /* 49 vars */.

close(3)

SYNOPSIS
#include <unistd.h>
int close(int fd);

DESCRIPTION
close() closes a file descriptor, so that it no longer refers to any file and may be reused. Any record locks (see fcntl(2)) held on the file it was associated with, and owned by the process, are removed (regardless of the file descriptor that was used to obtain the lock). If fd is the last file descriptor referring to the underlying open file description (see open(2)), the resources associated with the open file description are freed; if the file descriptor was the last reference to a file  which has been removed using unlink(2), the file is deleted.
In this function call the argument integer file descriptor is 3. The 3 refers to the underlying open file description which was set three lines earlier, “openat(AT_FDCWD, "/etc/ld.so.cache", O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC) = 3”       

pread64(3, "\6\0\0\0\4\0\0\0@\0\0\0\0\0\0\0@\0\0\0\0\0\0\0@\0\0\0\0\0\0\0"..., 784, 64) = 784

SYNOPSIS
#include <unistd.h>
ssize_t pread(int fd, void *buf, size_t count, off_t offset);

DESCRIPTION
pread() reads up to count bytes from file descriptor fd at offset offset (from the start of the file) into the buffer starting at buf. The file offset is not changed.
In this function call the first parameter, file descriptor, is 3, the second parameter is a void pointer to a buffer, the third parameter is a size_t count of 784 bytes, and the fourth parameter is an offset of 64. The command returned 784 indicating that it successfully read 784 bytes, after the offset from the start of the file, into the buffer.

1) Lines 1175 and 117C initialize the looping variable i (DWORD PTR [rbp-0x8]) and return variable x (DWORD PTR [rbp-0x4]). The loop starts on line 1183 which is a jump to line 118d. On line 118d, DWORD PTR [rbp-0x8] is compared to 0x9. The next line, jle 1185 <f+0x1c> is a jump to line 1185 if i is less than or equal to 9. At line 1185, the variable x is incremented by one and on line 1189, the variable i is incremented by one. The loop stops when i is not less than or equal to 9. Thus, the final value of x is 10.

2) Line 1185 increments the return variable x ([rbp-0x4]) by the add command. Then, lines 1189 to 1191 increment i and jump back to the start of the loop on line 1185 if i less than or equal to 9. Once the loop completes and x has a value of 10, it is copied to eax on line 1193 for further use.

3) The value of x stored in eax is moved to esi and 0 is moved to eax before the printf function is called. On line 1198, the command lea, loads the effective address in rdi into [rip+0xe65] where rip is later used on line 1074 within printf. Line 11a4 calls printf by the call command to label 1070 <printf@plt> which is associated with line 1070. Line 1074 jumps to the address referenced by the address pointed by rip+0x2f55. This results in the stored value of x displayed following the message “Value of x:”.
